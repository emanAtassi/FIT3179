        <h1 id = "title">Electricity and Clean Energy Across the World</h1>
        <p>
            In an era defined by progress and innovation, the global demand for electricity has surged to unprecedented heights. 
            Electricity, often referred to as the lifeblood of modern civilization, powers our homes, industries, and economies, 
            enabling the conveniences and advancements we often take for granted. However, this remarkable energy source comes 
            with a significant responsibilityâ€”its production and consumption can impact our planet's health and sustainability. 
            This is where the concept of clean energy enters the stage.
        </p>
        <p>

            Clean energy, a term synonymous with environmental stewardship, represents a pivotal shift in the way we generate and harness electricity.
            It champions sustainability, striving to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate the harmful emissions they produce. 
            Clean energy sources encompass a wide array of technologies, from wind and solar power to hydropower, geothermal energy, and beyond. 
            These sources not only reduce our carbon footprint but also offer the promise of a greener, more sustainable future.
        </p>
        <p>

            The journey towards clean energy is multifaceted, involving international cooperation, policy changes, technological advancements,
            and public awareness. It transcends borders, as countries worldwide seek to balance their growing energy needs with the imperative
            to protect our environment. From initiatives to improve access to electricity in underserved regions to ambitious renewable energy goals,
            the global community is forging a path towards a more sustainable and electrified world.
        </p>
        <p>
            
            In the pages that follow, it explores a series of visualizations that illuminate the diverse facets of electricity and clean
            energy on a global scale. These visual insights offer a deeper understanding of the global use of <span class="keywords">electricity consumption and sources</span>, 
            and compares the progress of <span class="keywords">countries' progress</span>, or lack thereof, of leading a sustainable world.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data used in  this visualisation ranges from 2000 to 2020, or 2019 for some charts. Please view the page in full view

        <h3>Access to Electricity Across the World (%):</h3>

        <div class="pure-g">
            <div class="pure-u-1-1">

        <div class="description">
            <p>
                The chart below is a <span class="keywords">choropleth map</span>, which displays the % of individuals that have <span class="keywords">access to electricity per country</span>.
                The <span class="keywords">slider</span> below allows for filtering the values by year. Move the slider through to see the progress of countries' 
                accessibility to electricity!
                The <span class="keywords">map scale</span> allows for zooming into the map to get a more detailed look.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <span class="keywords">colour scale</span> used denotes the % of access to electricity, <span class="keywords">where the darker the colour, the higher the %</span>. 
                Note that some countries are in grey due to missing data.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we can see from the map, most countries, if not all, have experienced a positive improvement from 2000 in terms of 
                citizens having access to electricity. Especially <span class="keywords">Afghanistan</span> for instance; it improved drastically <span class="keywords">from 2% to 97%</span>!
                These changes indicate electricity has become profoundly more accessible in the past two decades, and invites hope that
                it will only become more widely accessible in the future.

        <h3>Financial Aid ($US) to Developing Counrties vs Access to Clean Fuels (%):</h3>

        <div class="description">
        <p>
            This is a <span class="keywords">proportional symbol map</span>, which displays the financial aid received by developing countries (in $US) vs
            their access to clean fuels as a %. Clean fuels refers to fuel that is safe for consumption, such as for cooking. 
            The <span class="keywords">size of the circles</span> denotes the average amount of financial aid received in that particular year per 10,000 persons.
            The <span class="colours">colours</span> denote the % of clean fuels accessed by citizens of a particular country.
        </p>
        <p>
            Likewise to the above graph, there is a <span class="keywords">year slider</span> that filters data by the chosen year, as well as <span class="keywords">a map scale</span> that 
            allows for zooming into the map. Zoom in to get a closer and clearer look at the data!
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, it can be said from the graph that <span class="keywords">the bigger the circles, the darker the colour</span>, which indicates receiving financial 
            aid may assist in having more access to clean fuels for use. However, there are many countries whre despite receiving a substantial
            amount of aid, they still lack in access to clean fuels. This indicates that, in fact, the correlation between financial aid and 
            accessing clean fuels is not very strong.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite receiving financial aid for clean energy initiatives, many countries in regions like <span class="keywords">Africa</span> face persistent challenges 
            in achieving widespread access to clean fuels. Factors such as inadequate infrastructure, economic constraints, political instability, 
            and a lack of technical expertise can impede progress. 
            Additionally, cultural preferences, energy subsidies, and global energy dynamics play a role.

                        which describes the installed renewable energy capacity per person. 
                        Each <span class="keywords">circle</span> represents a country, and the <span class="keywords">size</span> of the circles denotes the population of said country. 
                        Moreover, the <span class="keywords">colour scheme</span> denotes the continent to which the country belongs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is a <span class="keywords">year slider</span> that allows for filtering the data by a specific year. 
                        There is also a <span class="keywords">checkbox</span> if you want to review the entire data for all years.

                       We can see that there a <span class="keywords">positive correlation</span> between the GDP and Renwable Energy, which highlights that the

                    <p>
                        Overall, we can see that <span class="fossil"><b>fossil fuels</b></span>, despite their detrimental harm on the environment, are the dominant source 
                        of electricity due to their historical infrastructure, 
                        reliability, high energy density, and cost-effectiveness in many regions. Additionally, energy security and political 
                        influence play significant roles in their continued use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you filter through the countries, we can see that <span class="keywords">Asian, African and American</span> countries suffer the most from lack
                        of clean energy like <span class="nuclear">nuclear</span> and <span class="renewable">renewables</span>. On the other hand, <span class="keywords">European countries such as Sweden and Switzerland</span> dominate in their use of <span class="nuclear">nuclear</span>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The variation in energy source usage among countries stems from a blend of historical, geographic, economic, and policy factors. 
                        For instance, early investments in clean energy, geographical access to resources, economic development levels, government policies,
                         and cultural attitudes all play a role. Some countries have abundant <span class="renewable">renewable</span> resources and prioritize them, while others rely on
